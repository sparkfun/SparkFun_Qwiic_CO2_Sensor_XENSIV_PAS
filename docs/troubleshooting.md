## Ideal Installation Recommendations

For ideal measurements, Infineon has several recommendations for installing the sensor in the final application found in this [application note](). The list below outlines most of them but for complete information, refer to the app note linked above.

* Allow a space above the sensor at least 12mm tall with a minimum opening size of 14mm x 14mm.
* Avoid direct airflow in front of the sensor.
* Isolate the sensor from ambient heat sources.
* Isolate the sensor from vibration sources.
* Avoid placing the sensor in direct sunlight.
* Prevent any condensation/water contact with the sensor.

## Calibration Procedure

The PASCO2V01 sensors require a week long calibration period, measuring every 10 seconds. During that period, the sensor *must* be outside for at least 30 minutes while taking measurements. Refer to the [Automatic baseline offset correction (ABOC) and forced compensation scheme (FCS)](./assets/component_documentation/Infineon-AN_FCS_ABOC_XENSIV_PASCO2_2-ApplicationNotes-v01_04-EN.pdf) application note for complete information about the calibration process. The graph below shows three sensors data outputs merge together during our calibration testing:
