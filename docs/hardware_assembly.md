Now that we're familiar with the PAS CO2 sensor and other hardware on this breakout, it's time to assemble it into a circuit.

## Qwiic Assembly

SparkFun's Qwiic system makes assembling a circuit a breeze. Simply plug the breakout into your chosen microcontroller with a Qwiic cable. After assembling your circuit, it should look similar to the photo below:

# Soldered Assembly

Those who prefer to use either the UART or PWM interfaces or the other pins broken out on this board should solder wires or header pins to the PTH pins on the side of the board. If you're not familiar with through-hole soldering or would like a refresher, take a look at our Through-Hole Soldering Tutorial:
