	If this is your first time using Arduino, please read through our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide). If you have not installed an Arduino library before, we recommend you check out our [installation guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library).

Infineon has written an Arduino Library for the PAS CO2 sensor to make it easy to get CO<sub>2</sub> data from the sensor along with other settings and features. Users can download the library through the Arduino Library Manager by searching for <b>"XENSIVE PAS CO2x"</b> as the screenshot below shows:

Those who prefer to manually install it can download a ZIP of the library from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Infineon/arduino-pas-co2-sensor) or by clicking the button below:
